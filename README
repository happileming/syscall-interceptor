Yeah-yeah, I know we can manipulate strace(1) output by shell built-in/awk/whatever-wrapper.
But we cann't do shit with strace if viewing syscall is not enought.

I've implemented pretty simple functions allowing to inject before and after syscall => fully control execution flow.
See handle.c for details.

btw there's surely uncaught cases of wait4 in log.c which can lead to WTF's.
I'm NOT gonna fix that in the near future.
